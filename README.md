# ArtifactsRemoval

We will generate artifacts by using the library TorchiO, which is explained in the next paper:

Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine (June 2021), p. 106236. ISSN: 0169-2607. doi: 10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106236.


Moreover, we make use of super-resolution convolutional neural networks described in:
